/**
 * Mediator design pattern is a behaviourial pattern 
 *  that aims to promotes loose coupling between objects 
 *  by introducing a mediator object that coordinates communication 
 *  between the objects
 *  
 *  An example of the Mediator pattern in action might be a chat room 
 *  application, where each use is an object and the chat room itself is the mediator.
 * The users can send messages to each other through the mediator (the chat room), which 
 *  helps decouple the objects from each other and promotes 
 *  a more organised and maintainable communication structureu
