/*
	Memento 
	Is a behavioural design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an obevt 
	without revealign the deails of its implementation

	It is used to capture the object's internal state, storing it in such a way that it can be restored later, if needed
	without violating the object's encapsulation.

	The pattern consists of three objects:
		- the originator (the object whose state needs to be saved)
		- a caretaker (the object that saves and restores the originator's state),
		- memento (the object that stores the orignator's state)
