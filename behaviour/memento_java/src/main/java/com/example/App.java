 *  Memento Design 
 *  - Design pattern is a behaviourial pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to 
 *    its previous state without violating encapsulation 
 * 
 * This pattern consists of 3 main components:
 * - Originator: The object whose state needs to be saved and restored 
 * - Memento: An object that stores the state of the Originator 
 * - CareTaker: an object that manages and keeps track of Memento
