/**
 *      Observer
 *
 *      Is a behaviourial design pattern that lets you define a subscription 
 *      mechanism to noftify multiple objects about any events that happen 
 *      to the object they're observing 
 * 
 *      All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher's state are 
 *      called Subscribers.
 *  
 *      Is also known as the Publish/ Subscribe pattern, and is used to implement 
 *      one to many relationships between objects in which one object acts as the 
 *      publisher, while the other act as subscribers, and notifications when the
 *      publisher's state changes
 *
