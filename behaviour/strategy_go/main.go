	The Mediator design pattern is a behaviourial design pattern that provides a centralised communication for 
	for objects in a systenm


	This pattern promotes loosse coupling between objects by removing direct connections
	between objects and instead requiring them to communicate indirectly through mediator 

	This can lead to a reduction in the number of relationship between objects and simplify the 
	design of complex systems
