/**
 * Template Method is behaviourial design pattern that defines the skeleton of an 
 * algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm 
 * without changing its structure 
 * 
 * 
 * The idea behind the pattern is to defne a common structure for 
 * similar algorithms, and then allow subclasses to provide specific implmentation 
 * details for certain steps of the algorithm 
 * 
 * This way, the overall structure of the algorithm remains the same across all 
 * subclasses, while the details of certain steps can be modified as needed
