 *    The VIsitor pattern suggests that you place the new behaviour into a separated
 *    class called visitor, instead of tryig to integrate it into existing classes. The original 
 *    object that had to perform the behaviour is now passed to one of the visitor's methods as an 
 *    argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object
