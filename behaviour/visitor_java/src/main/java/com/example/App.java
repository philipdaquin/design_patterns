 *  Visitor Design pattern
 * That allows adding new operations to existing oobjects wihtout changing their classes 

    It lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate 
    This is achieved by creating a separate object, called a visitor, that encapsulates the algorithm, and then 
    this visitor can be passed to the object needs to have the operation performed on it
