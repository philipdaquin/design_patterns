/*
    The Proxy design pattern is a structural desing pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for 
    another object to control access to it

    The primary intent of the proxy pattern is to create a representative object that can act as an intermediatry between 
    client and the real subject object 
    - The client interacts with the proxy object, which in turn delegates the requests to the real object

    - This allows the proxy object to add extra functionality to the real object or to retrict access to it 


    Types
    - Remote Proxy - local representation of a remote object 

    - Virtual Proxy - 

    - Protection Proxy
