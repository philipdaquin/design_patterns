 * The Proxy Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows for the creation

 * 
 * - The purpose of a proxy object is to control access to the original object or to add 
 *   additional functionality to it 
 * 
 * IN this example, the client interacts with the proxy object as if it were the real objectm 
 * but the proxy objects handles the actual interaction with the real objects
